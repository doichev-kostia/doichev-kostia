			<p class="text-base">
				I was born in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, and ever since I was a child, I've had a keen interest in engineering and
				architecture. Can't remember not exploring every detail of a newly bought car or building a LEGO house.

				<br />

				As I grew older, I found another passion: dancing. I became a professional dancer and spent eight years
				performing on stages around the world. It was an incredible experience, and I learned so much about
				discipline, creativity, and perseverance.

				<br />

				However, I eventually decided to shift gears and pursue a career in software engineering. I am currently
				studying at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where I am learning all about software development and computer
				programming.

			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-5 text-slate-200">My current involvement</h3>
			<p class="text-base">
				As a developer, I am mainly involved in front-end development, particularly with React. I am comfortable
				working with a variety of tools and libraries within the React ecosystem and actively exploring the
				fast-evolving world of the front end. While front-end development is my main focus, I also have some
				experience in back-end development with Node.js.
				<br />
				I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and committed to continuously improving
				my skills as an engineer.
